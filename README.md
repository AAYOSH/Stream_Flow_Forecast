# Stream_Flow_Forecast
Project developed in the post graduate subject IA048-Machine Learning at FEEC,UNICAMP. Multi-step ahead forecast using direct and recursive method in a LSTM neural network

## Objectives
This project has the objective of forecasting the streamflow in a hydroelectric power plant. The forecasts were made in a daily basis frequency, with a 7 days ahead prediction using the direct and recursive methods. The model used was the LSTM recurrent neural network with a dense layer attached to the output. The results shows that both methods of multi-step ahead prediction had close RMSE values considered all the 7 days predicted, and the direct method performed better in the last days of the horizon, while the recursive had a better performance in the first 2 days of the horizon.
